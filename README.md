# 🎮 p5.js Game Project – University of London BSc CS

This is a 2D browser-based game developed using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) as part of the *Introduction to Programming* course in the **University of London BSc Computer Science** program.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP), animation loops, collision detection, and basic game mechanics in JavaScript with the p5.js library.

Developed entirely in the browser, this game was my final submission for the programming module, designed to apply core programming concepts in a creative, interactive way.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **JavaScript (ES6)**
* **[p5.js](https://p5js.org/)** – creative coding library for visual programming
* HTML5 / CSS3
